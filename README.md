# Symfony TUI Games

Terminal games built as a **showcase for the `symfony/tui` component**.

Each game deliberately exercises a different slice of the TUI API — styling,
borders, compositing, keybindings, tick loops — so the project doubles as a
living, playable reference for the component.

> [!WARNING]
> This project depends on **`symfony/tui`**, an experimental component not yet on Packagist.
> It is tracked via `vendor-src/symfony/tui` (submodule of `fabpot/symfony` branch `tui`).
> Follow the setup instructions below to get started.
